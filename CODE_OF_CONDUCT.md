# Introduction to yonode

Welcome to yonode, the Node.js Toolkit for Rapid Development that empowers developers to kickstart their projects with ease and efficiency. At the heart of yonode lies a commitment to innovation, offering a robust starting point for integrating various databases and ORMs, while seamlessly supporting both JavaScript and TypeScript. Our toolkit is designed to streamline development processes, featuring a rich ecosystem of controllers, models, routers, authorization and authentication mechanisms, and much more.

Yonode is more than just a toolkit; it's a community of forward-thinking developers who are passionate about crafting scalable, high-quality software. We believe that the foundation of a thriving open-source project is not only great code but also a welcoming and inclusive environment. This Code of Conduct outlines our dedication to fostering a respectful community where everyone, from any background, can contribute, share ideas, and express themselves freely.

By participating in the yonode project, you join us in our mission to revolutionize Node.js development, creating a space where collaboration flourishes, innovation is celebrated, and diversity is embraced. Together, we can build something extraordinary.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
